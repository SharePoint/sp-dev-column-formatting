# File Preview

## Summary
On click the file preview will open in a new tab. This is the same preview as used in the fileviewer webpart.
So no toolbars, no context. It is therefore recommended to open it a new tab.

## View requirements
- The format can be applied to any column, although it is recommended to add it to a calculated column with a ="" formula
- Folder are currently problematic and return an error.
